# T3 Analysis

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis done with the data provided, I have found the following insights and recommendations for T3:
1. **Popular Trucks**: The most popular trucks based on the number of transactions are Burrito Madness and Cupcakes by Michelle.
    - These cuisines (Mexican and Desserts) could be considered to spread to other locations.
2. **Payment Methods**: The most commonly used payment method is cash, though it is very evenly split. This may be due to Super Smoothie not accepting card payments. 
    - It is recommended to ensure that all trucks accept multiple payment methods to cater to customer preferences.
3. **FSA Ratings**: Most trucks have high FSA ratings (4 or 5), though Super Smoothies and King of Kebabs drop to 3 and 2 respectively.
    - These trucks should be reviewed to identify areas for improvement in food safety and hygiene practices.
4. **Underperforming Trucks**: Hartmann's Jellied Eels has the least number of transactions, followed by Super Smoothie.
    - Super Smoothie's low performance could be attributed to its limited payment options or low FSA rating.
    - It may be beneficial to investigate the reasons behind Hartmann's Jellied Eels low performance, such as location or menu offerings.
